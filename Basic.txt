What is Data Structure?
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

It is a way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

Classification of Data Structure

1. Linear Data Structure
    a. Static Data Structure
        i. Array

    b. Dynamic Data Structure
        i. Linked List
        ii. Stack
        iii. Queue

2. Non-Linear Data Structure
    a. Tree
    b. Graph


1. Linear Data Structure 
-> In this data structure, the data is stored in a sequential manner. each element is connected to its next element. examples are array, linked list, stack, queue.

    a. Static Data Structure
    -> In this data structure, the size of the data structure is fixed. examples are array.

    b. Dynamic Data Structure
    -> In this data structure, the size of the data structure is not fixed. examples are linked list, stack, queue.

2. Non-Linear Data Structure
-> In this data structure, the data is stored in a non-sequential manner. each element is connected to its next element. examples are tree, graph.

-> we can't traverse all the elements in a single run.

Popular types of Data Structure:

    v. Tree
    vi. Graph
    vii. Binary Tree
    viii. Binary Search Tree
    ix. Heap
    x. Hashing
    xi. Graph
    xii. Matrix
