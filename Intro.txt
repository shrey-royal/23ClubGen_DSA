Array: Collection of data belongs to the same data type. 
> It is a fixed size sequential collection of elements of the same type. 
> An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type. 
> Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. 
> A specific element in an array is accessed by an index. 
> All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. 
> The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.

Common Operations on Arrays:

> Insertion: insert at first, insert at last, insert at any position
> Traversal: Print array elements in forward and backward direction
> Updating: Update any element of array based on index, Update all elements of array based on given value.
> Deletion: delete first element, delete last element, delete any element based on index, delete all elements based on given value.
> Merging: merge two arrays into one array
