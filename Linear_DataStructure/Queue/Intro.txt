Queue Data Structure: Follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle.

> Simple (One ended) queue
> Double Ended Queue (Deque)

Basic Operations performed on a queue:
    1. Enqueue (Insertion at the end)
    2. Dequeue (Deletion from the front)
    3. Front (Peek)
    4. Rear (Peek)
    5. isEmpty
    6. isFull

Applications of Queue:
    1. CPU Scheduling
    2. Disk Scheduling
    3. Simulations
    4. Call Center Phone Systems
    5. Handling of Interrupts in real time systems
    6. Traffic Management
    7. Asynchronous Data Transfer
    8. IO Buffers
    9. Accessing shared resources in a multi-threaded environment
