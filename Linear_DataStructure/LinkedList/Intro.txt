Linked List: It is a linear data structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part.

> Where is it used?
> To store the data at different memory locations.
> To store data dynamically.

> What are the advantages of Linked List over an array?
> Dynamic size
> Ease of insertion/deletion
> Memory efficient

Types of Linked List:
1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular Linked List


Types of Operations that we can perform on Linked List:
1. Insertion -> Insertion at the beginning, Insertion at the end, Insertion at the given position
2. Deletion -> Deletion at the beginning, Deletion at the end, Deletion at the given position
3. Traversal -> forward traversal, backward traversal
7. Updation -> Update the value at the given position
8. Reversing -> Reverse the linked list
